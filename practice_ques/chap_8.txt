1. Does PyInputPlus come with the Python Standard Library?
   
   No.
   
2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pyip?
   
   Coz, writing pyinputpus.input*() everytime we had to use the module's function will not be very efficient.


3. What is the difference between inputInt() and inputFloat()?

   inputInt() accepts only integer values (including numbers like, 4.00) and inputFloat() accepts float data type input.   


4. How can you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99 using PyInputPlus?
   
   pyip.inputInt(min=0, max=99)

   The regex that are allowed in the input string goes in allowRegexes and the regex that shoul NOT be present in the input string goes in the blockRegexes argument.
