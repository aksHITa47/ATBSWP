1. Briefly describe the differences between the webbrowser, requests, bs4, and selenium modules.
   
   webbrowser opens a browser to a specific page using the URL provided in the open() method. requests downloads files and web pages from the internet. bs4 parses HTML. selenium launches and controls a web browser. The selenium module is able to fill in forms and simulate mouse clicks in this browser.


2. What type of object is returned by requests.get()? How can you access the downloaded content as a string value?
   
   Response object. It has a text attribute that contains the downloaded content as a string.


3. What requests method checks that the download worked?
   
   raise_for_status() method


4. How can you get the HTTP status code of a requests response?
   
   The status_code attribute of the Response object contains the HTTP status code


5. How do you save a requests response to a file?
   
   Open a file in 'wb' “write binary” mode, using a for loop that iterate over the Response object’s iter_content() method to write out chunks to the file (preferable size of 100000 bytes)


6. What is the keyboard shortcut for opening a browser’s developer tools?
   
   F12 for Chrome and Ctrl+Shift+C for Firefox


7. How can you view (in the developer tools) the HTML of a specific element on a web page?
   
   Right-click the element in the page, and select Inspect Element from the menu.


8. What is the CSS selector string that would find the element with an id attribute of main?
   
   "#main"


9. What is the CSS selector string that would find the elements with a CSS class of highlight?
  
   ". highlight"
   

10. What is the CSS selector string that would find all the <div> elements inside another <div> element?
    
    "div div"

11. What is the CSS selector string that would find the <button> element with a value attribute set to favorite?
    
    'button[value="favorite"]'

12. Say you have a Beautiful Soup Tag object stored in the variable spam for the element <div>Hello, world!</div>. How could you get a string 'Hello, world!' from the Tag object?
    
    spam.getText()


13. How would you store all the attributes of a Beautiful Soup Tag object in a variable named linkElem?
    
    linkElem.attrs


14. Running import selenium doesn’t work. How do you properly import the selenium module?
    
    from selenium import webdriver


15. What’s the difference between the find_element_* and find_elements_* methods?
    

    find_element returns first matching element and find_elements returns a list of all matching elements


16. What methods do Selenium’s WebElement objects have for simulating mouse clicks and keyboard keys?
    
    click() simulates mouse clicks and send_keys() simulates keyboard keys


17. You could call send_keys(Keys.ENTER) on the Submit button’s WebElement object, but what is an easier way to submit a form with selenium?
